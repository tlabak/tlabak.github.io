				Electric-Electric Guitar Embedded System

			<p>
				An interesting name, isn’t it? As one who is quite interested in the art of music and the creation of instruments, it was natural to make an embedded system that assumes all aspects of being a musical device. An electric guitar isn’t quite like the electric-electric guitar with one differing aspect: the creation of sound. In an electric guitar, one plucks a metal string to vibrate at a specific frequency, to change the magnetic field of the pickup component, which effectively induces an electromotive force (EMF) creating an electrical signal to be amplified. In essence, this process is more so a mechanical conversion to electrical energy by electromagnetic induction. In the electric-electric guitar, all signals are created internally by the microcontroller of the embedded system. Using embedded C, an electric signal is created computationally through logic and signal processing to then be transduced into an acoustic signal with an external speaker. The guitar mechanical strings are replaced by sensors to actuate a sound wave at a particular frequency by a touch event. Such an instrument allows for the extension of creativity with what one can do and produce whilst playing this guitar, removing the limiting element of mechanical sound creation to digitally being able to create unique sounds and process the signal directly to apply cool effects for a different auditory experience.

				Wireless Transmission of Power Between Electronic Devices

				Power Electronics

			<p>
				Wireless Transmission of Power (WTP) is a sophisticated, marvelous attribute of nature in electrodynamics. It involves transmitting electrical power without a physical link and, in near-field applications, utilizing time-varying electromagnetic (EM) fields to transfer power wirelessly. The purpose of the project for wireless transmission of power between electronic devices is to mitigate the need for a physical link between a source and a load for mobile devices, which effectively decreases the requirement for additional infrastructure within the power system and the increase of range for an electronic device to receive power liberally. Additionally, experimentation allowed for the exploration of defining how the parameters of a wireless power electronics system dictated the efficiency of the power transfer, aiming to achieve the ideal combination of parameter conditions for an optimal efficiency. This project focused on developing a power electronics PCB module that ought to be implemented within personal electronic devices, such as a smart phone or a laptop computer, as well as experimenting with the extents of the transmission of wireless power.

				32-bit Pipelined CPU Design with New ALU Architecture

			<h3>
				VLSI Case Study
			</h3> -->
			<p>
				The purpose of this case study is to gain a further understanding of different 32-bit pipelined central processing unit (CPU) designs' performance; the comparison between different full-bit adders to showcase the delays, power consumption, and processing frequency of each design. Coupled with the concern of having a fast, high-performing CPU, a new arithmetic logic unit (ALU) architecture should be implemented and compared to the pre-existing full-adder designs. A pipelined CPU is capable of handling many instructions at once, and in this design, the CPU uses 32-bit length words, therefore the architecture for processing a plethora of computations in unison becomes critical in its front-end and back-end design optimization. The integration of the CPU is synchronized by an external clock and other signals to direct operations and operands for the ALU and instructions for addressing the memory file. Using the environments Cadence Virtuoso, Xcelium, Genus, and Innovus, along with the RTL design being written in Verilog HDL, allowed for the compilation, construction, and simulation of developing a high-performing, fast processing CPU.

				Secure Delivery Package Embedded System

			<h3>
				DelBox
			</h3> -->
			<p>
				To address the needs of ensuring the security of a package delivery, keeping the contents inside safe, the completion of the first prototype “DelBox” provides a demonstration of a promising solution that incorporates Internet of Things (IoT) technology to create a harmonious cyber-physical system. The problem of concern is in regards to “porch pirates”, which have been on the rise in correlation to the increase in online shopping, where one willingly steals a package that typically sits on the porch of one’s house or apartment building. DelBox is an IoT system that takes in sensed data from its environment that includes the perception of its orientation and ambient temperature, to provide the user with information on the status of the package. Additionally, DelBox incorporates a locking system in which a user is provided a password to unlock the package and access the contents inside. The package communicates the information wirelessly in order to store its sensed data in the database that holds the vital parameters of the system. To provide insight to the user, an application allows for the viewing of the real-time characteristic parameters, such as if the box is open or close, locked or unlocked, and the ambient temperature as well as to control the locking mechanism remotely. Overall, DelBox takes a step in the direction of making the delivery process more secure.

				Microgrid Software Application

			<p>
				Microgrids are the key in achieving a fully sustainable future for power generations and management. Moving to microgrids will allow for a reduction in large scale outages as well as the option for maintaining a sustainable image. Flexibility of grid infrastructure allows for the freedom to model a system for many geographically and economically diverse situations. This project is a software application, medGRID, that advocates for the implementation of a microgrid power system in hospitals. medGRID is a user-friendly application that allows hospital administration to input their geographical, property area, and power demand data to provide an output of a predicted cost analysis for the installation of infrastructure, a general microgrid model fit for the hospital, the infrastructure and sustainable power generation required, as well as the environmental impact from implementing a microgrid.
